I followed [this](https://github.com/Nercury/rust-and-opengl-lessons) OpenGL Rust lessons guide to include Lesson 09.
At that point I felt like I wanted to take things in my own direction, and learn more about OpenGL, and Rust in general by
trying to make something, instead of continuing to follow the guide. I'll check back later to see what the newer lessons have
available.
